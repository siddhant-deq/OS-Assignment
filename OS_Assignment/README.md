# Operating System Algorithms

An implementation of common OS algorithms related to process scheduling, memory management, and file system implementation in JavaScript.
Use `node <file>.js` to run the JS files. 

## Process Scheduling Algorithms `process_scheduling/`
The processes to be scheduled can be given to the input array in each file. 
The order of execution, and the average waiting and average throughput times will be output to the console.
* First Come First Serve `FCFS.js`
* Shortest Job First `SJN.js`
* Round Robin `RR.js`

## Memory Management Algorithms `memory_management/`
The processes to be allocated can be given to the input array in each file.
The memory allocation at multiple time instants will be output to the console. 
* Contiguous Allocation - Fixed Partitioning `fixed_partitioning.js`
* Contiguous Allocation - Dynamic Partitioning `dynamic_partitioning.js`
